      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in Massachusetts, just outside of Boston, along the Charles River.
      By age 6, I knew all the subway stops on the Green line from Riverside to downtown Boston. And I could
      easily find my way from Park Street Station to my favorite Boston stores (Jordan Marsh and Filenes).
      </p>
      <p>As a kid I wanted to be either an Actor or an Astronaut.
      Since I was not able to afford good colleges, I was never able to get the Astronaut required PHD.
      However, I found a back-door into the Russian Space Program.
      I was able to build and fly 4 home-made educational Amateur Radio projects into space.
      Three projects were installed on the Russian Space Station Mir [1997-2000] and one project was installed on
      the International Space Station [Slow Scan TV, 2004-2006].
      </p>
      <p>I am done with the Software/Imaging and Space Station projects.
      Now I am focusing my energies on Acting!
      Since my father was a photographer, I learned how to take-pictures and develop/print my own film in grade
      school. In the 1990â€™s I switched from Film to Digital cameras and Video cameras.
      Now its time for me to work in front of the camera.
